i saw a bag in a tree that looked sad<BR>
it was dancing around in the breeze<BR>

can live forever it seems<BR>
they're kinda like plants<BR>
they die and come back<BR>
and then one day wash up on the beach<BR><BR>

 and planet earth is spinning<BR>
 in the back seat of a car<BR>
 and out the window aeroplanes<BR>
 look just like shooting stars<BR>
 oh, but i'm not wishing anymore<BR>
 cos my hands turned to monkey paws<BR>

i've got a jumper, its grey and maroon<BR>
it's got baggy sleeve and it smells like my room<BR><BR>

and i think it's growing, unless i am shrinking<BR>
and sometimes out the corner of my eye, i see it breathing<BR><BR>

my jumper's alive and it's doubling in size<BR>
better run, better hide<BR>
cos my jumper, my jumper's alive<BR><BR>

i've got a jumper and it keeps me warm<BR>
in cold weather, together, we meld into one<BR><BR>

and i think it's eating the things in my room<BR>
and somehow it is using them to make more wool<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and i think my jumper is hatching a plan<BR>
to keep eating and growing as much as it can<BR>
and when it's of size it'll cover the skies<BR>
they'll be no place to hide<BR>
cos we'll all be trapped inside of my jumper<BR>
my jumper, my jumper, my jumper's alive<BR><BR>

(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh)<BR><BR>

i've got a jumper, it's grey and maroon<BR>
it's warm and it's cosy and smells like my room<BR>
and i think it's growing, and i hope i'm not wrong<BR>

there's a stink here<br>
and it smells like something dead<br>
and i'm worried that it's me<br>
and it gets stronger by my bed<br>
so maybe i died in my sleep<br>
and i just haven't noticed yet<br><br>

 <i>chorus</i><br>
and the sun goes down a little later in the evening<br>
and the cigarettes go down a little faster in the day<br>
morning comes a-rolling past the window as you draw the curtains<br>
and before you know, tomorrow looks like yesterday<br><br>

and i should do some laundry<br>
cos i'm running out of jumpers<br>
but the weather's getting warmer<br>
so i think that i can bump it<br>
down the list of all the things<br>
i've got to do over and over<BR><BR>

 <i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and my brain's become obsessed<br>
with looking back at what is gone<br>
and all the things that i can't change<br>
because what's done is done is done<br>
but i guess it's that regret<br>
that keeps us on the road we're on<br><br>

pins and needles
</b><BR><BR>

lately i've had pins and needles all over my body<BR>
there's a lack of blood inside me and it's making me feel dizzy<BR>
i don't know where my blood has gone to<BR>
i have got no open wounds so<BR>
how my blood escaped is such a mystery<BR><BR>

and someone told me lately that my heart's just being selfish<BR>
that it's holding all my blood inside and doesn't want to share it<BR>
and my arteries and veins will dry<BR>
arms and legs and head'll die<BR>
and everything around my heart will perish<BR><BR>

but lately i've been thinking that if that is the case<BR>
maybe my heart's just being smart and saving for a rainy day<BR>
and my heart's not being selfish<BR>
it's just building up in strength<BR>
so when there comes something to love my heart is ready<BR><BR>

cos lately i've seen pins and needles everywhere i go<BR>
there's a lack of something in the wind that's blocking up the blow<BR>
but i want to feel love again<BR>
so i can feel my blood and then<BR>
i'll open up my heart and let it flow<BR><BR>

and until that comes along my heart will grow<BR>

halloween

i woke up at four this morning<BR>
but they changed the clocks back so i really woke at five<BR>
and i can't get the internet working<BR>
and i really wanna get this video finished in time<BR>
for halloween<BR>
halloween<BR><BR>

and all day i've felt kinda dizzy<BR>
and i found an uncooked chicken leg just lying in the yard<BR>
and i admit i wasn't listening<BR>
when they called to say i got the job and start<BR>
the day after halloween<BR>
halloween<BR><BR>

and now it's mid november and the chicken leg has gone<BR>
it eroded in the rain but now has come back in this song<BR>
along with all those tiny things i'd have forgotten otherwise<BR>
and that satisfying feeling that i got the video finished in time<BR>
in time for halloween<BR>

lightbulb

i left my phone in the office<BR>
tomorrow i have got to go to school<BR>
but i don'tknow where the school<BR>
i've a pizza in the oven<BR>
and the nights are growing cooler<BR><BR>

and the lightbulb in my bedside light exploded<BR>
and i caught a cold and so did everybody in the office<BR>
and the main lights are too bright -<BR>
they're the opposite of cosy<BR>
but they're making pretty colours<BR>
in the bubbles in pepsi<BR>
and i guess that i'll just take a guess<BR>
at where to find the school<BR>
unless i get a message back<BR>
from tom about it soon<BR>
and once i'm finished with this pizza<BR>
i'll go out and buy a lightbulb<BR>
but because it is the screw in kind<BR>
i'm worried they won't have one<BR>
and i won't be in the office<BR>
for at least another day<BR>
but i don't mind being phoneless<BR>
so i guess that that's okay<BR><BR>

and the lightbulb in my bedside light exploded<BR>
and my cold has nearly cleared up<BR>

dancing in the light of the fire<BR>
and you can call them insane and say they're asking for pain<BR>

and a rain cloud that came from the place it was made<BR>
opens up and starts to put out the fire<BR>
and the people are soaked now and the fire's just smoke now<BR>
and soggy clothes and burnt out homes are all that remains<BR><BR>

and used expect sadness, but people are laughing<BR>
laughing in the rubble and rain<BR>
and you can say that they're hurt and say they're laughing from nerves<BR>

cyclops in the sky

i was staring at the sky<BR>
making stars inside my mind<BR>
putting pressure on my eyes<BR>
until my retinas are fried<BR>
and the stars go back to space<BR>
i made a cyclops of your face<BR>
by pressing my nose up to yours<BR>
until our eyes began to cross<BR><BR>

and just like planets, they align<BR>
just like the stars inside my mind<BR>
they burnt an image in my eyes<BR>
a ghost reminder made of light<BR>
so when the stars don't shine<BR>
they'll always be<BR>

i've got a skateboard and it only cost a fiver<BR>
and racing down the streets on it<BR>
it made me feel aliver<BR>
than i'd ever feel again<BR>
and i ever felt before<BR>
flying down the street on my skateboard<BR><BR>

but then it broke, and i lost two wheels<BR>
and it's hard just to describe to you exactly how that feels<BR>
when your skateboard breaks, right down the trucks<BR>
and i must confess the best i can explain is that it sucks<BR><BR>

oh, but this devastating incident isn't something new<BR>
so i brought the board back home and so i guess that that makes two<BR>
cos i broke this skateboard like i broke the one before<BR>
now i have two halves of a skateboard<BR><BR>

but i'll fix it up, and i'll ride again<BR>
cos two halves of a skateboard, oh, together they make one<BR>
i'll fix it up, it'll be the best<BR>
and i hope that i don't break this one just like i did the rest<BR><BR>

i was tired of socks<BR>

so i made some shoes<BR>
and decorated them with lots of cartoons<BR>
i made them out of a cardboard box<BR>

there's a guy i'll never know because he's dead

<BR>and his name was Burton Holmes and now he's dead<BR>
and he travelled round the world

<BR>making videos

<BR>and he sold them at his shows and now he's dead<BR><BR>

and with a camera in my hand
<BR>
i tried making videos

<BR>and i walked down to the bus stop<BR>

and gave travelling a go

<BR>i saw London in the sun

<BR>i saw Bristol in the snow

<BR>and i saw my pockets empty
<BR>
and i had to go back home<BR><BR>



and lately i have hated every video i've made
<BR>
and travelling on holidays just doesn't feel the same
<BR>
and i've been thinking of just setting off
<BR>
and getting on a plane

<BR>to L.A. California to find Burton Holmes' grave<BR><BR>



and standing on his skeleton and looking at his stone
<BR>
i'll see he lived for almost 80 years

<BR>while i'm just 21

<BR>so i guess it doesn't matter that i'm still getting things wrong<BR>
cuz really i'm still growing up

<BR>and the best is yet to come<BR><BR>

and it doesn't matter that Burton Holmes' dead

<BR>cuz others carry on for him instead

<BR>people still play shows

<BR>and make videos<BR>
and they still travel round the world

<BR>and they're not dead... <BR>

little bee

it's probably just nothing<BR>

i don't know how she got in<BR>
there's no doors or windows open<BR>
but hopefully she'll find her way out soon<BR>
it's not that i am frightened<BR>
i just worry that she'll die in here<BR>
my room is not an ideal place to be<BR>
there isn't food inside here<BR>
but there's definitely spiders<BR>
so i really hope that soon she will be free<BR><BR>

oh little bee<BR>
just keep trying and be brave<BR>
soon you will be free<BR>
don't make the window sill your grave<BR><BR>

now i hope that she is fine<BR>
and that she hasn't seen the flies<BR>
that are dead and lying on the window sill<BR>
cos it's such an awful sight <BR>
that it could fill her full of fright<BR>
or at the very least, make her feel quite ill<BR>
and if she starts to panic<BR>
it could make her actions manic<BR>
then escaping would be much more difficult<BR>
and if she's bouncing off the walls<BR>
it would be easier to fall<BR>
and she'd become a crippled bee as a result<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

now i really can't be certain<BR>
but right there on the curtain<BR>
i think i saw a spider climbing up<BR>
and if the bee's inside the curtain<BR>
that the spider's climbing<BR>
then the spider will be having her for lunch<BR>
but i hope that if she's caught<BR>
then she can turn it into sport<BR>
and that she's not the sort to fall without a fight<BR>
and she'll send the spider spinning<BR>
with just one flap of her wings and<BR>
then she'll effortlessly find her way back out<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

now i no longer hear a buzzing<BR>
but it probably was nothing<BR>
and there probably wasn't even a bee<BR>
just the sound of some machine<BR>
teamed up with my imagination<BR>
but i really hope that soon she will be free<BR>

2 years ago
</b><BR><BR>

about two years ago when the notebook i carried was red<BR>
no holes in my jeans and a whole lot of a dreams in my head<BR>
sat on a train with my life in a bag by my feet<BR>
and the music in my headphones making me one with the seat<BR>
watching the windows changing the form of the land<BR>
as the trees turn to buildings and pavements rise up from the sand<BR>
and the smells of the city seep in through the holes in the walls<BR>
fill my nose with adventure like nothing that i've smelt before<BR><BR>

but it's now 2 years later and my head is stuck in this frame<BR>
sat at a windowsill racing the droplets of rain<BR>
but the drops, they have stopped, and don't look like they'll start up again<BR>
and i'm sat at a windowsill wishing i was back on that train<BR><BR>

the back of the bus is flooded with light from the sun<BR>
shedding light on my head and the memories of things that i've done<BR>
heading west at a guess on this road cos who knows where it ends<BR>
it may lead to success, it may lead to the bestest of friends<BR>
it may lead to danger, it may lead to a hole in the ground<BR>
but that's the adventure so wherever i'm lead, i am bound<BR>
and the sounds of the bus make vibrations that i feel inside<BR>
a rumble in the left of my chest that means i'm alive<BR><BR>

but it's now 2 years later and my head is filling with dust<BR>
sat at a windowsill racing the droplets of mist<BR>
but the drops, they have stopped, and it looks like they've had enough<BR>
and i'm sat at a windowsill wishing i was back on that bus<BR><BR>

i took down the posters and photographs from my wall<BR>
put them in a pile with the rest of my things on the floor<BR>
and i took down the seats - made them flat in the back of dad's car<BR>
and piled on top all the things i would need for the year<BR>
and as we took to the road, took one last look at where i grew up<BR>
at the trees and the mountain, the school and the pump and the shop<BR>
we talked as we drove and we made jokes and we laughed<BR>
as we took the piss out of the big army trucks that we passed<BR>
the sun it was shining as the car came to a slow<BR>
and we pulled up outside of a place i would call home<BR><BR>

but its now 2 years later and i'm stuck hugging a guitar<BR>
sat at a windowsill racing drops lit up by stars<BR>
but the drops, they have stopped, despite not even getting that far<BR>
and i'm sat at a windowsill wishing i was back in that car<BR><BR>

but it's now 2 years later and my head is stuck in this frame<BR>
sat at a windowsill racing the droplets of rain<BR>
but the drops, they have stopped, and don't look like they'll start up again<BR>
and i'm sat at a windowsill wishing i was back in that car, on that bus, on that bike, on that plane, on the back of that horse, on that train<BR><BR>

on that train<BR>

i've got a jumper, its grey and maroon<BR>
it's got baggy sleeve and it smells like my room<BR><BR>

and i think it's growing, unless i am shrinking<BR>
and sometimes out the corner of my eye, i see it breathing<BR><BR>

my jumper's alive and it's doubling in size<BR>
better run, better hide<BR>
cos my jumper, my jumper's alive<BR><BR>

i've got a jumper and it keeps me warm<BR>
in cold weather, together, we meld into one<BR><BR>

and i think it's eating the things in my room<BR>
and somehow it is using them to make more wool<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and i think my jumper is hatching a plan<BR>
to keep eating and growing as much as it can<BR>
and when it's of size it'll cover the skies<BR>
they'll be no place to hide<BR>
cos we'll all be trapped inside of my jumper<BR>
my jumper, my jumper, my jumper's alive<BR><BR>

(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh)<BR><BR>

i've got a jumper, it's grey and maroon<BR>
it's warm and it's cosy and smells like my room<BR>
and i think it's growing, and i hope i'm not wrong<BR>
cos then i could share my jumper with everyone<BR>

mostly cloudy

my eyes were glued to the computer screen<BR>
as if it were my own face<BR>
my finger's binded with the keyboard<BR>
i'd become a mechanical disgrace<BR>
spending hours converting flesh into machine<BR>
until all my humanity was gone<BR>
i was gonna spend the summer outside<BR>
under blue skies having fun<BR>
spending august in a field with friends<BR>
getting drunk and getting rowdy<BR>
but when i checked the weather on the internet<BR>
it said mostly cloudy<BR><BR>

and in front of my computer is where i stayed<BR>
i didn't move from that spot<BR>
when it occurred to me sometime in mid-august<BR>
that it was actually quite cool being a robot<BR>
and i went outside and said "i am a robot<BR>
my laser eyes could hurt you quite a bit<BR>
and my super-sonic strength<BR>
could rip up buildings and shit"<BR>
but when the sun parted from the clouds<BR>
and shone down on my metallic skin<BR>
it was so hot it melted my outer-core<BR>
and melted everything within<BR>
and as i lay a metal puddle on the floor<BR>
i started to think loudly<BR>
how i wish the weather outside<BR>
had stayed mostly cloudy<BR>

well pretend were someone else<BR>

but we couldnt help the influence of papers and TV<BR>
cos hey recognised our cause and offered us rewards<BR>
and we ended up changing the world back to the way it was<BR><BR>

and our applause came in the hoards<BR>
and we asked for so much more and got bored of the rewards<BR>
and the buzz-words killed our voices and we thought it was progression <BR>
to pursue what we were doing in the name of some profession <BR>
but i never wanted to be professional<BR><BR>

i just want to be real <BR>
and feel that i am part of the world<BR>

im trapped in the cellar and its pretty dark <BR>
and i can barely see my fingers but they look a bit like sharks <BR>
cos they are grey and they are swimming in the blackness of the room <BR>
and theyre eating little fishes made of dust and pretty soon <BR>
theyll eat me<BR><BR>

im gonna be <BR>
eaten by fingers in a room with no TV <BR>
so i wont even know the news <BR>

to draw a picture that i sold <BR>
to a profit of a man who said hed said offer me some gold <BR>
and i dont know if he liked it cos he pushed me down the stairs <BR>
and now im in a cellar and im pretty scared of the dark<BR><BR>

beware of the cellar cos the cellar sells your soul<BR>
and he thinks hes a fortune teller but he just needs more gold<BR> 
so hell lock you in the dark <BR>
turn your fingers into sharks <BR>
and they will eat you<BR>

werewolves

i know it's night but we all need to get away from this town<BR>
so grab your shoes and i will meet you up on top of the downs<BR>
we need to get some place where we won't be too scared to be loud<BR>
cos we're gonna make sounds like the hounds that we are<BR><BR>

cos half a month ago the moon was half but now it is full<BR>
it shines so bright and it turns everything a silvery blue<BR>
and what a great excuse to go outside and do something cool<BR>
right under the stars<BR><BR>

cos the wolves are inside us and they'll come back alive<BR>
making shapes with our bodies and controlling our minds<BR>
and while the full moon is out<BR>
we will be howling and shouting<BR>
and devouring everything that makes it difficult to live out our lives<BR><BR>

and when the sun returns we'll all go back to living like dogs<BR>
put our collars on and all go out  and try to get jobs<BR>
and spend our saturdays and all our pay on tours of the pubs<BR>
and default to the people we never wanted to be<BR><BR>

and we'll be dreaming of that chase that took place under the trees<BR>
up on the downs, under the moonlight, where we acted like beasts<BR>
but we got stuck when we got back and forgot what we believed<BR>
and we stopped being free <BR><BR>

but the wolves are inside us and they'll come back alive<BR>
making shapes with our bodies and controlling our minds<BR>
and while the full moon is out<BR>
we will be howling and shouting<BR>
and devouring everything that makes it difficult to live<BR>
so tonight let's do it right and give it all we've got to give<BR>
let's release the beasts and have the best damn night of our lives<BR><BR>

mammoths in the snow

a few million years ago, there were mammoths in the snow <BR>
and the snow turned into water, and the mammoths turned to bones<BR>
and the snow turned into water, flowed to rivers to the sea<BR>
and the mammoth bones were dug up, now there's mammoths on tv<BR>
and the sea flowed through the fishes and then turned into the clouds<BR>
and a museum brought a mammoth that they found inside the ground<BR>
and the clouds got kinda heavy and they turned back into water<BR>
and a mammoth in a movie has the voice of a new-yorker<BR>
and the water from the clouds got cold and turned back into snow<BR>
and snowed just like it had done, a few million years ago<BR>
and it snowed on the museum, and the rooftops of new york<BR>
and on people outside cinemas, deciding what to watch<BR>
and it snowed on top of aerials on houses across the nation<BR>
so the tvs in those houses were all getting bad reception<BR>
so the tv screen's all fuzzy and its hard to see the show<BR>
but theres just the faintest picture of <BR>
mammoths in the snow<BR>

oh, but this devastating incident isn't something new<BR>
so i brought the board back home and so i guess that that makes two<BR>

now i have two halves of a skateboard<BR><BR>

but i'll fix it up, and i'll ride again<BR>
cos two halves of a skateboard, oh, together they make one<BR>
i'll fix it up, it'll be the best<BR>

we're gonna die

<i>chorus</i><BR>
oh my! we're gonna die<BR>
we're gonna smoke our pockets dry<BR>
thinking that's how we'll get by<BR>
and we'll survive<BR>
but then in time<BR>
we're gonna die<BR><BR>

we're always worrying about the future<BR>
always dwelling on the past<BR>
but never thinking bout the now<BR>
because the present never last<BR>
but it's now that take our money<BR>
and it's now that takes our sense<BR>
but it's also now that takes the piss<BR>
and now that takes the chance<BR>
and that past we always think about<BR>
the now is where it's from<BR>
and when you think like that<BR>
the tenses all roll into one<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and the things get more expensive<BR>
as the jobs give better pay<BR>
then the jobs all stop<BR>
and the expenses stay the same<BR>
and the moths inside my wallet<BR>
they have no concept of wealth<BR>
and the butterflies inside my lungs<BR>
have no concept of health<BR>
and there's no use in fretting<BR>
getting scared of what comes next<BR>
cos we all know the ending<BR>
just be thankful for the rest<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and you can waste some hours telling people life is short<BR>
and you can waste days, months and years, begging for some more<BR>
and you could spend a lifetime wishing that you'd had more fun<BR>
but they'll always be more time<BR>
cos life's so goddam long<BR><BR>

living out my days inside of my head<BR>

and with a backpack full of crap<BR>
i'm gonna have another crack<BR>
at travelling around the land<BR>
and never ever coming back<BR>
and i will live on the road<BR>
just like the travellers of old<BR>
making art and telling stories<BR>
in exchange for some gold<BR><BR>

i got no money for the bus<BR>

cosmic bike

spend a couple of decades there i guess, then i'll be on my way<BR>
to venus where it's said you'll find true love, or at least find true like<BR>
but in all that atmospheric fog, i'd be lucky to even find my bike<BR>
and i'll<BR><BR>

and i'll skip on past the earth, and head on down to mars<BR>
and if there are some martians, we'll hang out in martian bars<BR>

cos i'll just hang on the planet's surface with those american robots<BR>
and i'll<BR><BR>

but with over sixty moons that obscure his view he won't see me passing by<BR>
as i<BR><BR>

and i'll stop at an alien market and buy a cheap guitar<BR>
so i know what it's like to play when you're surrounded by the stars<BR>

but you forget about neptune's winds and how they can be quite ferocious<BR>
and you end up being blown backwards and landing on uranus<BR>
so i'll<BR><BR>

ride my bike<BR>
across the galaxy<BR>
exploring space at a steady pace<BR>
my cosmic bike and me<BR><BR>

and in school they definitely told me that pluto is a planet<BR>
but those scientists on the tv say it's just some rock in the sun's orbit<BR>
so what else in school were they lying about? is there no god who's omnipotent?<BR>
did shakespeare not write that scottish play? is trigonometry not important?<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and before returning to earth, my bike and i will stop off at the moon<BR>
sit together beside a crater and look out at the view<BR>
and i know it's a cliche but the world looks great from space - it looks just like it oughta<BR>
free from greed and social awkwardness - it's just land and water<BR>
and soon i'll be back down there wound up in the old routine<BR>
and my intergalactic freedom will just be a distant dream<BR>
so i unlock my cosmic bike from it's lunar bike rack<BR>
get back on the saddle, but instead of going back<BR>
i will just<BR><BR>

ride my bike<BR>
across the galaxy<BR>
explore more of this place that they call space<BR>

burton holmes

there's a guy i'll never know because he's dead

<BR>and his name was Burton Holmes and now he's dead<BR>
and he travelled round the world

<BR>making videos

<BR>and he sold them at his shows and now he's dead<BR><BR>

and with a camera in my hand
<BR>
i tried making videos

<BR>and i walked down to the bus stop<BR>

and gave travelling a go

<BR>i saw London in the sun

<BR>i saw Bristol in the snow

<BR>and i saw my pockets empty
<BR>
and i had to go back home<BR><BR>



and lately i have hated every video i've made
<BR>
and travelling on holidays just doesn't feel the same
<BR>
and i've been thinking of just setting off
<BR>
and getting on a plane

<BR>to L.A. California to find Burton Holmes' grave<BR><BR>



and standing on his skeleton and looking at his stone
<BR>
i'll see he lived for almost 80 years

<BR>while i'm just 21

<BR>so i guess it doesn't matter that i'm still getting things wrong<BR>
cuz really i'm still growing up

<BR>and the best is yet to come<BR><BR>

and it doesn't matter that Burton Holmes' dead

<BR>cuz others carry on for him instead

and they still travel round the world

100 balloons
</b><BR><BR>

a hundred balloons escaped from the fair<BR>
a hundred civilians looking into the air<BR>
and as time stopped and slowed down, it's laws no longer applied<BR>
as folks stared at the balloons getting higher in the sky<BR>
and no one said anything - nobody made a sound<BR>
until every last balloon had disappeared in the clouds<BR>
then time started back up again in it's usual fashion<BR>
and everyone moved on as if nothing had happened<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR>
what do the balloons do when they go into space?<BR>
do they implode? do they explode? do they stay in one place?<BR>
do they fly all around and hang with other lost balloons?<BR>
or do they keep their heads down and get caught up on the moon?<BR><BR>

one hundred photographs put on the net<BR>
so that one hundred people would never forget<BR>
about the time that they saw all those balloons<BR>
appear and then disappear at a quarter past noon<BR>
the moment was magic, like you'd see on tv<BR>
a symbolic moment to break up the story<BR>
but they are not sub-plots - balloons have stories of their own<BR>
and they don't cease to exist, just because away they've flown<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

we could tie cameras to the balloons to see where they go<BR>
but when i think about it, i don't really want to know<BR>
i'm just happy looking upwards watching them fly<BR>
to some great balloon mystery that resides above the sky<BR>
and maybe when i die, i will reincarnate<BR>
and come back as a balloon and find out where they migrate<BR>
and maybe when i get there i'll look down on the ground<BR>
and ask myself another question that is just as profound<BR><BR>

like where do all those bubbles go when they disappear?<BR>
do they go forward in time to some far away year?<BR>
and what do stars think about as they sit in space?<BR>
do they ever get lonely? do they ever feel afraid?<BR>
and you know those monsters that live under your bed?<BR>
what happens to their bodies after they're dead?<BR>
and where do pencil lines go after they've been erased?<BR>
and what do the balloons do when they go into space?<BR>

there are things that i give out<BR>

in a small attempt to make somebody smile<BR><BR>

you have better things to give<BR>
things that make people realise living is worthwhile<BR><BR>

will never have that kind of effect<BR>

but your box<BR>
was already in her hands<BR>
and it was too much too withstand<BR>
and so she dropped my box and it fell to the ground<BR><BR>

and the lid it came off<BR>
as the box fell to the pavement<BR>
and all my things they shattered on the floor<BR>
but looking at the mess<BR>
i didn't feel much less<BR>
in fact i felt much freer than before<BR><BR>

and i don't care that i'm no longer carrying a box<BR>
cos it means my arms now feel the breeze as i swing them when i walk<BR>
and i hope, for real, that your box isn't difficult to hold<BR>
cos it must be fucking heavy<BR>
carrying all that solid gold<BR>

sailing

grains of sand are dots <BR>
when stood up against rocks<BR>
easily washed over<BR>
and easily forgotten<BR>
but with pockets full of pebbles<BR>
i'd find it hard to float<BR>
so i'll shed off this skin of stone<BR>
in favour of building a boat<BR><BR>

and i'm gonna sail til i run out of sea<BR>
then i'm gonna sail across flowers with the bees<BR>
and i'm gonna sail high among the trees<BR>
and i'm gonna sail til it's impossible to see me anymore<BR>
until i appear very small<BR>
until i am nothing more<BR>
than a dot washed up on the shore<BR>

there's ideas in his head that he probably ought to throw away<BR>
her room's to hot and it's a quarter to one<BR>

she's an astronaut<BR>
he would say out-loud almost everything she ever thought<BR>
they looked at each other and at what they'd become<BR><BR>

and he has one less sugar than he did before<BR>

a fly flies round his room all night and drives him insane<BR>

argumental words ricochet off the walls<BR>
he tries to make her cry<BR>
she wishes he would die<BR>
every other utterance is amplified a hundred times<BR>
the words are strong enough now to break down the walls<BR><BR>

though they can't stand each other<BR>
they'll always sit together<BR>
that's what makes them so clever<BR>
two heads are always better<BR>
and there lies in between<BR>
those times when they disagree<BR>
some moments of unity<BR>
a feeling of ecstasy<BR><BR>

he won't have milk in her tea anymore<BR>

little bee

it's probably just nothing<BR>
but i thought i heard a buzzing<BR>
and i think that there's a bee in my room<BR>
i don't know how she got in<BR>
there's no doors or windows open<BR>
but hopefully she'll find her way out soon<BR>
it's not that i am frightened<BR>
i just worry that she'll die in here<BR>

and that she hasn't seen the flies<BR>
that are dead and lying on the window sill<BR>

that it could fill her full of fright<BR>
or at the very least, make her feel quite ill<BR>
and if she starts to panic<BR>
it could make her actions manic<BR>
then escaping would be much more difficult<BR>
and if she's bouncing off the walls<BR>
it would be easier to fall<BR>

now i really can't be certain<BR>
but right there on the curtain<BR>
i think i saw a spider climbing up<BR>
and if the bee's inside the curtain<BR>
that the spider's climbing<BR>
then the spider will be having her for lunch<BR>
but i hope that if she's caught<BR>
then she can turn it into sport<BR>
and that she's not the sort to fall without a fight<BR>
and she'll send the spider spinning<BR>
with just one flap of her wings and<BR>
then she'll effortlessly find her way back out<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

now i no longer hear a buzzing<BR>
but it probably was nothing<BR>
and there probably wasn't even a bee<BR>
just the sound of some machine<BR>
teamed up with my imagination<BR>
but i really hope that soon she will be free<BR>

2 years later...
</b><BR><BR>

about two years ago when the notebook i carried was red<BR>
no holes in my jeans and a whole lot of a dreams in my head<BR>
sat on a train with my life in a bag by my feet<BR>
and the music in my headphones making me one with the seat<BR>
watching the windows changing the form of the land<BR>
as the trees turn to buildings and pavements rise up from the sand<BR>
and the smells of the city seep in through the holes in the walls<BR>
fill my nose with adventure like nothing that i've smelt before<BR><BR>

but it's now 2 years later and my head is stuck in this frame<BR>
sat at a windowsill racing the droplets of rain<BR>
but the drops, they have stopped, and don't look like they'll start up again<BR>
and i'm sat at a windowsill wishing i was back on that train<BR><BR>

the back of the bus is flooded with light from the sun<BR>
shedding light on my head and the memories of things that i've done<BR>
heading west at a guess on this road cos who knows where it ends<BR>
it may lead to success, it may lead to the bestest of friends<BR>
it may lead to danger, it may lead to a hole in the ground<BR>
but that's the adventure so wherever i'm lead, i am bound<BR>
and the sounds of the bus make vibrations that i feel inside<BR>
a rumble in the left of my chest that means i'm alive<BR><BR>

but it's now 2 years later and my head is filling with dust<BR>
sat at a windowsill racing the droplets of mist<BR>
but the drops, they have stopped, and it looks like they've had enough<BR>
and i'm sat at a windowsill wishing i was back on that bus<BR><BR>

i took down the posters and photographs from my wall<BR>
put them in a pile with the rest of my things on the floor<BR>
and i took down the seats - made them flat in the back of dad's car<BR>
and piled on top all the things i would need for the year<BR>
and as we took to the road, took one last look at where i grew up<BR>
at the trees and the mountain, the school and the pump and the shop<BR>
we talked as we drove and we made jokes and we laughed<BR>
as we took the piss out of the big army trucks that we passed<BR>
the sun it was shining as the car came to a slow<BR>
and we pulled up outside of a place i would call home<BR><BR>

but its now 2 years later and i'm stuck hugging a guitar<BR>
sat at a windowsill racing drops lit up by stars<BR>
but the drops, they have stopped, despite not even getting that far<BR>
and i'm sat at a windowsill wishing i was back in that car<BR><BR>

but it's now 2 years later and my head is stuck in this frame<BR>
sat at a windowsill racing the droplets of rain<BR>
but the drops, they have stopped, and don't look like they'll start up again<BR>
and i'm sat at a windowsill wishing i was back in that car, on that bus, on that bike, on that plane, on the back of that horse, on that train<BR><BR>

on that train<BR>

let's start a revolution<BR>
let's get rid of complication<BR>
and those academic dicks who make technique a competition<BR>
and let us all go back to playing simple chords<BR>
to when other people cared about other people's words<BR>
and we could all write songs and even though we writ them wrong<BR>
everyone would listen and everyone would sing along<BR><BR>

so pick up a pen<BR>
or a guitar or a bicycle<BR>
you don't have to be amazing to do something incredible<BR>
you don't need to be good<BR>
just cos they tell you you should<BR>
just fill your life with feeling and do things that are cool to do<BR><BR>

cos there's not a kid in the whole wide world who can't draw<BR>
but then they grow up and they stop and say they can't anymore<BR>
and people don't play music cos they think they'll be shit<BR>
but it's not how well you show off<BR>
it's what you get out of it<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and the brightest of fish live in the darkest of places<BR>
and the prettiest of people have the ugliest faces<BR>
and you could be content<BR>
but i don't think that's true<BR>
you're just another person bored, looking for something to do<BR><BR>

so why not pick up a pen<BR>
or a guitar or a bicycle<BR>
you don't have to be amazing to do something incredible<BR>
you don't need to be good<BR>
just cos they tell you you should<BR>
just fill your life with feeling and do things that are cool to do<BR>
pick up a pen<BR>

originality is a thing that i don't really rate<BR>
don't get hung up on finding new ideas, just concentrate on making something great<BR>
and it's only pleasing audiences that forces you to be different and new<BR>
you should just be happy there are others out there who are on the same wave length as you<BR>
don't be addicted to the effect, be addicted to the cause<BR>
cos you can be happy with something you've made, but you're always gonna want more applause<BR><BR>

i'm not a wise old man<BR>
and i should stop pretending that i am<BR>
i think the best advice, is found out for yourself<BR>
so i should just stop preaching while i can<BR><BR>

and i couldn't sit on a mountain top giving out advice<BR>
cos my wisdom can be shitty and i'm pretty scared of heights<BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR>
i come from dinosaur land<BR>
it's a pretty easy place to misunderstand<BR>
you might think it's pretty savage<BR>
you might think it's prehistoric<BR>
but the place has changed a lot since the end of the jurassic<BR><BR>

they've spent 65 million years building a society<BR>
where everyone is equal and they all live in harmony<BR>
where t-rex and triceratops are best friends forever<BR>

there are pterodactyl doctors and ankylosaur teachers<BR>
gallimimus scientists, tyrranosaur preachers<BR>
and some theropods with theremins have started a band<BR>

i come from dinosaur land<BR>
it's a pretty easy place to misunderstand<BR>

yesterday's garden

i saw an advert in yesterday's paper<BR>
that i'd seen before but i saved it for later<BR>
for reading when i was in a more favourable frame of mind<BR>
it said that today, at noon on the hour<BR>
these people some place were to give super powers<BR>
to anyone who arrived at that certain place at that time<BR>
but today is now yesterday, and tomorrow's today<BR>
and i think that by now it is quite safe to say<BR>
that i was too late and the only thing left to give now is dust<BR>
and now outside there are guys who move faster than lightning<BR>
and super strong kids whom i find a bit frightening<BR>
and people now travel by flying while i take the bus<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR>
on the day they gave out super powers<BR>
i was in the garden smelling some flowers<BR>
i guess i missed out, cos i was a little too late<BR>
now i feel more or less like a zero<BR>
cos everyone around me is a super hero<BR>
but at least the flowers in yesterday's garden smelt great<BR><BR>

and i know if i were to fall from a building<BR>
or get cut by some muggers and find myself bleeding<BR>
they'll always be someone to help and take me somewhere safe<BR>
but what if i hadn't been smelling those flowers?<BR>
would i by now have my own super powers?<BR>
and could i be my own hero and save my own life?<BR>
i can't be the only one who thinks that it's wrong<BR>
that everyone's super brave, super fast, super strong<BR>
cos who do they turn to when it's them who needs to be saved?<BR>
and i'm so relieved i was smelling those flowers<BR>
cos life seems so lonely for those who have powers<BR>
so when they fly past the bus window i give them a wave<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

but it's hard to ignore that voice in your head<BR>
that comes in the dark when you're lying in bed<BR>
and breaks up your dreams and tells you<BR>
you'll never fly<BR><BR>

on the day they gave out super powers<BR>
i was in the garden smelling some flowers<BR>
i guess i missed out, cos i was a little too late<BR>
now i'm not as super as everyone else<BR>
but i will just have to keep telling myself<BR>
that all of those flowers in yesterday's garden smelt great<BR>
yes, all of those flowers in yesterday's garden smelt great<BR>

canon

there once was a time, it was not long ago<BR>
when man stood on all fours and felt ever so low<BR>
he sat in the mud in a stint of depression<BR>
but soon all that sadness turned into aggression<BR><BR>

soon his rage was so much he could not keep it from others<BR>
so he beat up his sisters and beat up his brothers<BR>
he battled his neighbours and threatened those far away<BR>
he played war games with those who did not want to play<BR><BR>

he tore up the land and chopped down the trees<BR>
he polluted the skies and poisoned the sea<BR>
and soon there was nothing and no-one on which to wage war<BR>
but man was still angry with a need to raze more<BR><BR>

just one bird was left and man was intent it should die<BR>
so he raised up his rifle right up to the sky<BR>
but a song fluttered out from the beak of the bird<BR>
it was sweet and melodic  the best thing man had heard<BR><BR>

he put down his rifle and stood up to hear more<BR>
he stood on his back legs which he'd not done before<BR>
and all of a sudden the blood started to drain<BR>
from round his hot head and it freed up his brain<BR>
he could suddenly breathe, his lungs, no longer compressed<BR>
he was no longer angry and no longer depressed<BR>
man felt much better  he had been cheered up<BR>
and all it had taken was for man to stand up<BR>

i'm gonna make a sandwich<BR>
and it's gonna be quite nice<BR>
it's not gonna be amazing<BR>
but it's gonna be alright<BR><BR>

it might be peanut butter<BR>
or it might be jam<BR>
it could be cheese and pickle<BR>
or it might be ham (but probably not cos i'm vegetarian)<BR><BR>

sometimes i get real hungry<BR>
and it can be a bitch<BR>

and if you wanna come over<BR>
i'll let you have a bite<BR>
but don't expect the greatest taste of all<BR>
cos it's just gonna be alright<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and if you don't like sandwiches<BR>
you can still come round for tea<BR>
cos it wasn't as much about the sandwich<BR>
as about you hanging out with me<BR><BR>

(i mean..) <i>chorus</i><BR><BR>
i'm gonna make a sandwich<BR>

morning thoughts
</b><BR><BR>

i always squeeze the toothpaste from the middle<BR>
i always wake up in a pile of dribble<BR>
i always think in terms of riddles<BR>
and i always squeeze the toothpaste from the middle<BR><BR>

and if i squeezed it from the end<BR>
i'd probably get more out<BR>
and then my teeth wouldn't be a blend<BR>
of the colour of sick and the colour of doubt<BR>
but it takes pessimistic forward thinking<BR>
to avoid that kind of pickle<BR>
so i smile with yellow teeth<BR>
and i always squeeze the toothpaste from the middle <BR><BR>

i always wake up in a pile of dribble<BR>
i always think in terms of riddles<BR>
i always squeeze the toothpaste from the middle<BR>
and i always wake up in a pile of dribble<BR><BR>

and the spit's so warm and sticky<BR>
that it binds my pillow to my head<BR>
and we become one entity<BR>
when i wanna just get out of bed<BR>
but actually bed's quite warm and comfy<BR>
and getting out seems too much trouble<BR>
so i think i'll just spend the day in bed<BR>
lying here in my pile of dribble<BR><BR>

i always think in terms of riddles<BR>
i always squeeze the toothpaste from the middle<BR>
i always wake up in a pile of dribble<BR>
and i always think in terms of riddles<BR><BR>

and i'm over metaphorical and analytical<BR>
when i'm discussing something metaphysical<BR>
and no one really knows what i'm talking about<BR>
and really i don't either<BR>
it's like language is this damn<BR>
which stops my mind which is a river<BR>
and it's the symbolism that i use which is the wood<BR>
and i'm the beaver<BR>
but really life is just less boring<BR>
when you use imagery and drivel<BR>
which is why i'll continue talking bollocks<BR>
and always speak in terms of riddles<BR>
and always wake up in a pile of dribble<BR>
and always squeeze the toothpaste from the middle<BR>

secret letter to a plastic man
</b><BR><BR>

i don't wanna see your armour or your replicated mace<BR>
and get that electronic organiser the fuck out of my face<BR>
i dont wanna see no foreign coins or proof you've been on trains<BR>
or that plastic coated notebook that you'll use next time it rains<BR><BR>

i wanna see some coffee rings and i wanna see a pen<BR>
that you used until it ran out and still tried to use again<BR>
and i wanna see a cigarette and an old worn out guitar<BR>
you won't play in front of anyone unless it's underneath the stars<BR><BR>

and i've tried to be your friend<BR>
and i've tried to be your fan<BR>
but it's hard to feel affection<BR>
towards a plastic man<BR><BR>

and a property of plastic is it can change it's form<BR>
but for that to happen you have to get it warm<BR>
and recently you've been to places that are far from cold<BR>
and perhaps you melted down but you set in that same old mould<BR><BR>

and i'll try to be your friend<BR>
but i'll never be your fan<BR>
cos there's nothing that fantastic<BR>
about a plastic man<BR>
there's nothing that fantastic<BR>
about a plastic man<BR>

cosmic bike
</b><BR><BR>

i've got a ticket for the interstellar train<BR>
gonna pick up my bike from the garage on the sun<BR>
it needed a replacement chain and i got a phone call this morning saying it was done<BR>
so i can<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR>
ride my bike<BR>
across the galaxy<BR>
explore this place that they call space<BR>
my cosmic bike and me<BR><BR>

and i'll head on down to mercury where a year is shorter than a day<BR>
spend a couple of decades there i guess, then i'll be on my way<BR>
to venus where it's said you'll find true love, or at least find true like<BR>
but in all that atmospheric fog, i'd be lucky to even find my bike<BR>
and i'll<BR><BR>


<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and i'll skip on past the earth, and head on down to mars<BR>
and if there are some martians, we'll hang out in martian bars<BR>
but if there are no martians it won't be a mega loss<BR>
cos i'll just hang on the planet's surface with those american robots<BR>
and i'll<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and they say it's cold and lonely when you're stuck out in the void<BR>
so i hope i don't get a puncture on a passing asteroid<BR>
as i approach jupiter who's like big brother watching all with his big red eye<BR>
but with over sixty moons that obscure his view he won't see me passing by<BR>
as i<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and i'll stop at an alien market and buy a cheap guitar<BR>
so i know what it's like to play when you're surrounded by the stars<BR>
and i'll play all my song whilst sitting on saturn's outer rings<BR>
and it won't matter that all my songs are out of tunes, cos in space no one can hear you sing<BR>
and i'll<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and i might get that feeling, y'know, when you're going slow <BR>
and you think it's the road ahead that holds your fortune<BR>
so you stop smelling the astro-roses and you race ahead to neptune<BR>
but you forget about neptune's winds and how they can be quite ferocious<BR>
and you end up being blown backwards and landing on uranus<BR>
so i'll<BR><BR>

ride my bike<BR>
across the galaxy<BR>
exploring space at a steady pace<BR>
my cosmic bike and me<BR><BR>

and in school they definitely told me that pluto is a planet<BR>
but those scientists on the tv say it's just some rock in the sun's orbit<BR>
so what else in school were they lying about? is there no god who's omnipotent?<BR>
did shakespeare not write that scottish play? is trigonometry not important?<BR><BR>

<i>chorus</i><BR><BR>

and before returning to earth, my bike and i will stop off at the moon<BR>
sit together beside a crater and look out at the view<BR>
and i know it's a cliche but the world looks great from space - it looks just like it oughta<BR>
free from greed and social awkwardness - it's just land and water<BR>
and soon i'll be back down there wound up in the old routine<BR>
and my intergalactic freedom will just be a distant dream<BR>
so i unlock my cosmic bike from it's lunar bike rack<BR>
get back on the saddle, but instead of going back<BR>
i will just<BR><BR>

ride my bike<BR>
across the galaxy<BR>
explore more of this place that they call space<BR>
my cosmic bike and me<BR>

it takes nine months for a baby<BR>

call it home

there's a house in that tree<BR>
it's made from sticks and twigs and leaves<BR>
and bits of plastic bag and packs of tangy toms and mr. freeze<BR>
and there are eggs in it's belly<BR>
and a tiny little telly<BR>
so the baby birds that hatch can watch tv<BR><BR>

and there are houses on my feet<BR>
as i'm walking down the street<BR>
so y feet stay dry in weather whether there's rain, snow or sleet<BR>
and when your home is in your shoes<BR>
you can go anywhere you choose<BR>
and you'll always end up where you wanna be<BR><BR>

and there's a house underground<BR>
and it's filled with all the sounds<BR>
of a band of earthworms playing songs that no-one understands<BR>
and all the people on the surface<BR>
they are getting kinda nervous<BR>
cos the earthworm band is playing fucking loud<BR><BR>

and there are houses on my palms<BR>
where my fingers love to dance<BR>
making shapes like they're invisible to people walking passed<BR>
and when you make a hand a home<BR>
and make it dance like you're alone<BR>
before you know you'll be a master of your craft<BR><BR>

and there's a house in that pond<BR>
for a million kinds of frogs<BR>
and although they're tadpoles now, i'm sure they won't be like that long<BR>
because soon they will grow legs<BR>
and grow more developed heads<BR>
and be forced to leave the pond and get a job<BR><BR>

and when i threw my shoes into a tree<BR>
they turned into birds<BR>
and when i buried my hands underground<BR>
my fingers turned to worms<BR>
and i put my head under the water<BR>
and made it home<BR>

i'm a chameleon and just for the craic<BR>
i tried to imitate your pc but turned into a mac<BR>
i'm a cowboy in a wigwam, i'm a fire in a truck<BR>

so early in the evenings<br>
i don't mind it getting cold<br>
it's an excuse to wear a jumper<br>
and it feels like only last week<br>
we were sweating in the summer<br>
and it's nice to have a bit of rain<br>
and feel kind of connected<br>
to something that's much bigger<br>
than the lives that we've constructed<br>
and the music that the wind makes<br>
as it blows through scaffolding<br>
is like a symphany of man and nature<br>
played in  harmony<br>
and i hear that there's a storm a-coming<br>
better stay inside this weekend<br>
and catch up on all the books<br>
that you've told everyone you're reading<br>
and i love it after<br>
when the trees give off a stink<br>
it's just their way of saying cheers<br>
and thank you for the drink<br>
and nothing beats a walk out<br>
in the crisp air in the morning<br>
feels like strolling through the mouth<br>
of the world while it is yawning<br>
and the cold air hits your cheeks<br>
and makes your face a little redder<br>
and you bump into somebody else<br>
and talk about the weather<br><br>

is it gonna snow?<br>
i dunno.<BR>
